        <h4> <span style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">happy Friendship day <br> TURTLE-ESS</span> <br> I know late ho gaya but maine kabhi kisi ko wish kiya nahi. mujhe ye sab formality lagti thi but as a friend i should have atleast wished you! <br> I'm really sorry TURTLE-ESS.<br> btw this took some effort to make, did you like it?. <br> 
            <span style="background-color: rgb(248, 196, 151); border-radius: 5px; font-size: 15px;">
                From the moment I met you, it felt like I'm talking to a mirror. 
                <br> Your presence in my life has been nothing short of a miracle, how can two people have so much in common?? 
                <br> Whether weâ€™re laughing at the silliest things, supporting each other through tough times, talking late at nights, sharing our problems with each other, or simply enjoying the quiet moments together, every memory with you is a treasure.</span>
                <br> Thankyou TURTLE-ESS for always being there for me ðŸ«¶
